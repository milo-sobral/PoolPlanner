# PoolPlanner

This repository contains the code for a web app that I am using to learn Go and Angular.

### Functionality

Should Allow the user to:
* Create/Sign in to an account
* Choose to subscribe to a certain number of pools
* Get a URL for an iCal which they can use to get the updated open times for the pools that interest them directly into their calendar of choice.
